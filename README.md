## About Me:
Hello! Im an aspiring Computer Science student based in Scotland.

At school Ive learnt HTML, CSS, PHP and Visual Basic while at home Ive slowly learnt Python over the years and am now starting to learn Java.

Currently my focuses are on expanding my portfolio for my university application.

My list of projects to do are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Release proper Pygame game (shaders + trailer + good art + polished)</li>
  <li>Compete in GMTK game Jam</li>
  <li>“Python Projects” - (not got many ideas - maybe something with requests, matplotlib maybe. Use tkinter for GUIs)</li>
  <li>Make a website about me (using html, css and js)</li>
  <li>Make a few projects using Java (maybe some minecraft mods) </li>
</ul>
